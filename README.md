# Covid-X-RAY-Detector

This web app is developed for the detection of Covid from the X-Ray that is uploaded by the  the user. We have trained the model on multiple
images of Covid X Rays and Non-Covid X Rays. Resnet 50 model is used to train the model. A Flask App was developed where the user can upload Chest X-rays and get the output of possibility of COVID infection.

# Dataset
